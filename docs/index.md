# SABERTOOTH

A simple FTP file server explorer, and a backup tool you can use to backup your files/folders to a specific FTP server. You can stream video files on VLC player (if installed already) without having to download them. It is basically [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), but simpler, and with more user-friendly UI.

## The Story

After I set up my first NAS server, using an external HDD and Raspberry Pi 3, I installed Open Media Vault on it. At the time, I didn't know the existence of SMB, so I set it up as a FTP server. When I tried accessing it using FileZilla, It seemed too complicated, so I tried using Windows's native explorer, but that too was not what I'd imagined. It was slow, and it didn't let me stream videos. So I decided to make an app that was fast, allowed users to stream videos if they had VLC Player, and can be used easily.

## Status

You can install it easily, and there shouldn't be any major bugs. I won't be maintaining this project, unless a major bug surfaces.

## Installation

1. Download [Paws_Installer.msi](https://github.com/recoskyler/Paws/blob/master/Paws_Installer.msi).
2. (Optional) Check the SHA-256 checksum of the downloaded file: **2776A4FA3B718AB1E47895F03DB47AC5EDF851F6ACEA98F5C096CFBB4C3E1E25**
3. Run the installer as admin.
4. Follow the installer steps. I mean, you won't have to do anything, just click "Next" everywhere.
